## My personal site

##### for art and web projects

### October 2017

The first iteration of wesley.tech focused on my own learning of Polymer and displaying that I could launch a website.
It was my first of diving into Web Components (WCs), which I've now been following and learning around for a few years now.

This new static site relies only on HTML5 (ðŸ’šDOM), ES6, and a couple of small CSS libs: tachyons.io design system and a small animate.css library.
Thanks to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), for the beautiful, free photos! More of my personal art is on the roadmap.

Google Analytics event tracking is running; I generally understand *what you're doing*, but I am not currently making any efforts to determine *who you are*

#### future plans

Organizing content and modularization into WCs, adding more community built WCs.
Goal is to have JSON content indexes and the start of a home rolled tachy-powered WCs library.
