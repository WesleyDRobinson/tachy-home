## My personal site

##### for art and web projects

### November 2017

Next technical: wrap up in [hyperHTML](https://viperhtml.js.org/)

### October 2017

The first iteration (c.2015) of wesley.tech focused on learning Polymer and displaying that I could launch a website.
It was my first diving into Web Components (WCs), an inspiring spec that has really leveled out since then.

The 2017 version now relies only on HTML5 (ðŸ’šDOM), ES6, and a couple of small CSS libs: tachyons.io design system and a small animate.css library. Thanks to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), for beautiful, free photos! More of my personal art is on the roadmap.

Google Analytics event tracking is running; I generally understand *what's happening on my site*, but I am not currently making any efforts to determine *who you are*

End of October:
* ground up rebuild fully deployed
* finished initial goals of pleasant design, (techie) about me, and starting a code/ project portfolio
* updated to Webpack for build and dev from Browserify/Watchify + http-server
* becoming more comfortable and powerful with tachyons.io
* major open source find: unsplash.com & hyperHTML
