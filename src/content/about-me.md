### Still want to know a little more about me?

I grew up an Arkansas Ozarks hillbilly on a family-owned beef cattle ranch.

At Missouri State University (MSU), I studied chemistry and was heavily involved in campus and community
life.

After graduating with a Masters degree, I instructed at MSU and and Ozarks Technical Community College
(OTC).

Concurrently, I worked in practical research at Crosslink USA. As a team, we leveraged electroactive
polymers to prototype supercapacitors for controlled-release medical devices and aerospace sensors.

Concurrently dabbling in web development, my main focus at the time was learning cross-browser CSS3 and
jQuery.
Life is so much better in 2017
I didn't get far, but when shaking life up, I moved to the Big Apple and landed in Tech Recruiting

Taught myself some Javascript, then attended Fullstack Academy.
I moved to SF in 2015 to pursue my delusions of technology.

Now I work and learn at Segment.com solving problems for web developers. If you want a to understand
